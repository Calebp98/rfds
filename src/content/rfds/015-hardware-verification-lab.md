## The Idea

Prototype a hardware/software verification lab similar to the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC). The lab would perform chip reverse engineering, firmware audits, and verification protocol testing. Likely needed at significant scale eventually—worth laying groundwork now.

Existing capabilities: IC Masters, TechInsights, LTEC (chip RE for counterfeiting/competitive analysis), Battelle Memorial Institute, reduced-capacity HCSEC in UK.

## Why It Matters

Verification hardware is only trustworthy if someone can audit it. A dedicated lab with the right equipment and cleared personnel is infrastructure that takes years to build. Starting now means it's ready when verification regimes require it.

## Open Questions

- What equipment/personnel is needed for each verification task?
- What organizational structure (government, nonprofit, consortium)?
- How to handle international trust in lab findings?
